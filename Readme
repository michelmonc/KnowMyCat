Our project allows the user to upload a photo through a website we have created that is then transported to our code. 
After collecting the photo of the user's cat, Our code helps identify what breed of cat the user owns or would like to adopt.

What has inspired us is the passion that we have to assist heroes who devote their lives to rescuing cats.
It is unfortunate to say that some people bring harm to their four-legged companions by not being able to provide the correct food and resources for their specific type of breed. Our project, 
will allow anyone to, at no cost,  identify their pet and allow for families to rescue more dogs by allowing them to know the breed of their potential pet. 


We are using Python in Jupiter Notebook to create an AI that we will train using a dataset of different 
cat breeds that will train our CNN to recognize the different breeds and provide a graph of the different breeds present in the cat.
To input the dataset into the CNN we will be using Google Drive and to allow users to input the images to test our product we will be using a web
